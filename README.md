# PyTorch Template

My personal PyTorch project template to provide a streamlined starting point for Python projects.

## Features

- **Dependency Management**: Uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency and environment management.
- **Static Analysis**: Integrated with:
  - [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/): A fast Python linter and formatter.
  - [Pytest](https://pytest.org/): A framework for running unit tests.
- **DevContainer Support**: Preconfigured [DevContainer](https://containers.dev/) for a seamless development environment using Docker and VSCode.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerized development (optional but recommended).
